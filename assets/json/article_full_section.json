{"1": "Based on the current knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, wearing a mask has been recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) measurements enable designing and regulating medical masks to prevent bioaerosol dissemination; however, despite the simplicity of these measurements, several scientific questions remain unanswered regarding BFE tests. Here, we investigated (1) the impact of substituting 100-mm Petri dishes with 90-mm disposable Petri dishes, (2) the impact of colony-counting methods on the bioaerosol aerodynamic size, and (3) the impact of colony-counting methods on the total viable particle counts. We demonstrated that disposable 90-mm Petri dishes can be used to replace the 100-mm dishes. We also showed that an automatic high-resolution colony counter can be used to directly count viable particles on collection substrates and to measure the bioaerosol size parameters. Our results enable possible modernization of the outdated testing methods recommended in the US and European standards for BFE measurements. Specifically, use of a modernized colony counter should be clearly regulated and permitted to avoid the counting of positive holes. The median aerodynamic diameter appears to be the most relevant parameter for characterizing bioaerosol size. We described the results obtained from one plate from a positive BFE run to qualitatively illustrate the colony-counting methods considering the Petri dish corresponding to stage 3 of the ACI in Fig.\u00a0,. Using method 1, we observed 479 colonies with the automatic HD counter (considering these 479 colonies as viable particles, they should be equivalent to 279 positive holes as per the conversion table). Using method 2, we observed 584 viable particles (the result of converting the 479 colonies observed using the automatic HD counter if the 479 counts are considered positive holes). Using method 3, we visually counted 307 positive holes corresponding to 584 viable particles after conversion. Thus, the automatic HD colony counter allowed counting\u2009>\u2009400 colonies on the plates (e.g., 479 counts in this example).,For a quantitative analysis, we performed eight positive BFE runs (corresponding to 48 Petri dishes to be counted because six plates were analyzed in positive runs). The results from methods 1 and 3 did not statistically differ, while method 2 resulted in greatly overestimating the colony counts (Fig.\u00a0,). Method 4 was used as a reference to estimate the total airborne bacteria emitted by the bioaerosol nebulizer. A nonstatistical difference was observed between methods 1 and 3 and reference method 4.,Impact of colony-counting methods on the total number of collected bacteria in the six stages of the ACI for positive BFE runs (n\u2009=\u20094 for two different bacterial suspensions; 8 nebulizations/100-mm Petri dish according to the ACI instruction manual). Method 1 corresponds to direct colony counting using an HD counter (2781\u2009\u00b1\u2009460 counts). Method 2 corresponds to direct colony counting using an HD counter and converting the count into viable particles (7659\u2009\u00b1\u20091177 counts). Method 3 corresponds to visual colony counting of positive holes and then conversion (2638\u2009\u00b1\u2009480 counts). Method 4 was used as a reference, corresponding to the approximation of the total airborne bacteria emitted by the bioaerosol nebulizer (3014\u2009\u00b1\u20091144 counts). ns: not significant; *p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.01; ***p\u2009<\u20090.001.,We performed eight positive BFE runs (corresponding to 48 Petri dishes because 6 plates were analyzed via positive runs) using 100-mm Petri dishes (Fig.\u00a0,) and eight other positive BFE runs using 90-mm disposable Petri dishes. We found that (1) the bacterial challenge was similar between the positive runs using either the 100-mm or the 90-mm Petri dishes (no statistical difference in the counts for method 4), (2) use of the 90-mm Petri dish yielded similar counts to those of the 100-mm Petri dishes for methods 1 and 3, and (3) the only impact from using the 90-mm plates occurred with method 2, which was irrelevant to counting the total bacteria/viable counts from the results in Fig.\u00a0, (Fig.\u00a0,, Supplementary Table ,).,Impact of Petri dish size (90\u00a0mm vs 100\u00a0mm on the x-axis) on the total number of collected bacteria for the different colony-counting methods. The total number of collected bacteria was calculated on the six stages of the ACI for positive BFE runs (n\u2009=\u20094 for two different bacterial suspensions; 8 nebulizations). White bars: 90\u00a0mm petri dishes. Grey bars: 100\u00a0mm petri dishes. Method 1 corresponds to direct colony counting using an HD counter (2111\u2009\u00b1\u2009310 counts for 90-mm dishes; 2781\u2009\u00b1\u2009460 counts for 100-mm dishes). Method 2 corresponds to direct colony counting using an HD counter and then conversion into viable particles (5299\u2009\u00b1\u2009916 counts for 90-mm dishes; 7659\u2009\u00b1\u20091177 counts for 100-mm dishes). Method 3 corresponds to visual colony counting of positive holes and then conversion (1809\u2009\u00b1\u2009329 counts for 90-mm dishes; 2638\u2009\u00b1\u2009480 counts for 100-mm dishes). Method 4 was used as a reference, corresponding to an approximation of the total airborne bacteria emitted by the bioaerosol nebulizer (3222\u2009\u00b1\u20091323 counts for 90-mm dishes; 3014\u2009\u00b1\u20091144 counts for 100-mm dishes). ns: not significant; *p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.01; ***p\u2009<\u20090.001.,Two aerosol size parameters were calculated for each colony-counting method. Aerosol particle sizing was defined in terms of median aerodynamic diameter (MAD) or mean particle size (MPS). MAD was determined using the cumulative curve count vs. size according to European standard NF EN 13544-1. The polydispersity of the bioaerosol size distribution was calculated with the geometric standard deviation (GSD) parameter, equal to (d,/d,),, where d84 and d16 represent the diameters of the aerosol distributions at 84% and 16%, respectively. First, compared with method 3 (the gold standard recommended by the EN 14683:219), only method 2 showed no statistical difference, and method 1 appeared to overestimate the aerosol size (Fig.\u00a0,). The MPS and MAD also led to disparate values, with the MAD value being from 0.17 to 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m higher than the MPS value (Supplementary Table ,). Figure\u00a0, shows the aerosol size distribution of the bioaerosol emitted by the nebulizer. The bioaerosol distribution appeared polydisperse (whatever the methods used we observed a GSD range between 1.38 and 2.22, Supplementary Table ,), with particles\u2009<\u20091\u00a0\u00b5m (typically in the [5\u201315%] range depending of the method used and\u2009>\u20094\u00a0\u00b5m (again typically in the [5\u201315%] range depending of the method used), even when the major distribution mode of the aerosol distribution was centered around 2.5\u00a0\u00b5m (Fig.\u00a0,).,Impact of colony-counting methods on bioaerosol aerodynamic size (n\u2009=\u20092 for two different bacterial suspensions; 4 nebulizations/90-mm Petri dish). (,) Refers to the Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MAD). (,) Refers to the Mean Particle Size (MPS). Method 1 corresponds to direct colony counting using an HD counter (4.04\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16\u00a0\u00b5m for MAD; 3.70\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26\u00a0\u00b5m for MPS). Method 2 corresponds to direct colony counting using an HD counter and then conversion into viable particles (3.60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22\u00a0\u00b5m for MAD; 3.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u00a0\u00b5m for MPS). Method 3 corresponds to visual colony counting of positive holes and then conversion (3.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u00a0\u00b5m for MAD; 3.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.32\u00a0\u00b5m for MPS). ns: not significant; *p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.01; ***p\u2009<\u20090.001.,Aerosol size distribution (n\u2009=\u20092 for two different bacterial suspensions; 4 nebulizations/90-mm Petri dish). Method 1 (open circles) corresponds to direct colony counting using an HD counter. Method 2 (closed squares) corresponds to direct colony counting using HD counter and then conversion into viable particles. Method 3 (closed hexgons) corresponds to visual colony counting of positive holes and then conversion. Using an appropriate Petri dish size is critical because it will alter the distance between the jet orifice and the collection surface at each stage of the ACI. Furthermore, because of the static charge generated, plastic Petri dishes can reduce the particle collection efficiency by the ACI. Using specific glass Petri dishes (~\u2009100\u00a0mm in diameter) may seem like a minor detail but is logistically important when performing BFE tests. Each BFE test for each mask type requires counting 48 Petri dishes (five test specimens, two positive control runs, one negative control run, and six Petri dishes for all eight of the six-stage viable ACI experiments). Considering a workload of 10 BFE tests/day, as Petri dishes should be incubated for 20\u201352\u00a0h according to EN 14683:2019, a stock of 960\u20131440 glass Petri dishes is needed with time-consuming washing and sterilization steps for hundreds of dishes per day.,To our knowledge, all laboratories that assumed high rates of testing during the period of very high demand for mask performance validation during the first half of 2020 used sterile plastic consumable Petri dishes. Some authors in the 1950s and 1980s also reported using disposable plastic Petri dishes, which are more convenient if the quantity of the medium inside the Petri dish is adjusted to maintain the correct distance between the impactor stage and the collecting surface,. Thus, our study revealed that using 90-mm Petri dishes yielded similar counts to those of the 100-mm Petri dishes for methods 1 and 3 (Fig.\u00a0,). Additionally, even if methods 1 and 3 did not statistically differ, the total bacterial count decreased when the 90-mm plates were used compared with the counts for the 100-mm plates (Fig.\u00a0,). This seems logical since the decrease in surface area for the impaction of particles inside the ACI is\u2009~\u200920% when using a 90-mm dish rather than a 100-mm dish. However, very few particles are impacted on the collection surface on the edges of the dish, which explains why this decrease did not significantly affect the total bacterial counts.,Several points can be made regarding the qualitative approach proposed from the example of the dish in Fig.\u00a0,. Because the Six-Stage Viable ACI is a 400-orifice cascade impactor, the counts obtained using method 1 cannot correspond to positive holes since the maximum number of positives holes for a plate is 400. Therefore, direct counting using the automatic HD counter seems to correspond more to viable particles rather than to positive holes. In other words, use of a modern optical HD colony counter enables directly counting the viable particles on plates since several colonies can be easily observed at each impaction site coming from the same hole. Thus, if method 1 corresponds to a direct and accurate viable particle count, the result should be in good accordance with the count obtained using method 3. However, here, method 3 seemed to overestimate the viable particle count (584 for method 3 versus 479 for method 1). However, using the conversion table for positive-hole counts\u2009>\u2009300 can also induce biases. This difference of approximately 100 viable particles corresponds to a difference of only 28 positives holes (279 for method 1 vs 307 for method 3). In other words, without the overestimation of 10% of the positive-hole counts during the visual counting corresponding to method 3, methods 1 and 3 would have yielded similar counts of viable particles. Even if nothing is concluded at this stage, a 10% overestimation error (approximately 30 positive holes) when visually counting the positive holes via method 3 is more reasonable than a 20% underestimation error (approximately 100 colonies) when directly counting using the HD colony counter via method 1. The true value may be a compromise between the true counts of viable particles from both methods.,Quantitative analysis (Fig.\u00a0,) revealed that direct counting using an automatic HD counter yielded similar results to those obtained using the gold standard procedure recommended in EN 14683:219. Methods 1 and 3 were also in good accordance with the estimation of the total airborne bacteria emitted by the bioaerosol nebulizer (method 4, Fig.\u00a0,), indicating that these two methods are reliable for calculating the true viable particle counts. However, method 1, although more expensive because it requires purchasing an HD automatic colony counter, has the advantages of being completely operator-independent, extremely fast, reproducible and highly precise. The automatic recording of an image for each Petri dish analyzed allows maintaining traceability of the results and reinterpreting them a few days or weeks later if necessary. Thus, regulatory bodies should authorize use of these modern colony counters for performing BFE tests on masks.,We demonstrated that method 2 using the automatic HD counter was rigorously similar in terms of MPS and MAD calculations using method 3 (the gold standard recommended by EN 14683:2019 ). The results showed that the automatic HD counter could be a useful and reliable alternative for calculating the MPS parameters needed for BFE testing of face mask performances.,MPS and MAD yielded significantly different values, with the MPS always yielding values that were lower than those of the MAD (Fig.\u00a0,). Statistically, this difference indicates that the aerosol size did not follow a normal distribution. Standard statistics based on normal distributions tend to be unsuitable for most aerosol size distributions. Generally, lognormal distributions tend to the best fit for single source aerosol as is the case for BFE experiments. Aerosol size distribution is typically described by the mean (the first raw moment of the size distribution), the mode (the peak or maximum value of the size distribution), and the median (the middle value of a dataset, 50% of the particles are smaller than the median, and 50% are larger). The advantage of the median over the mean (often known as the average) in describing data is that the median is less skewed by a small proportion of extremely large or small values; thus, it often provides a better idea of a \u201ctypical\u201d value. Considering the relatively high aerodynamic size polydispersity (for method 3 recommended by US and EN standard a GDS range between 1.89 and 2.22, Supplementary Table ,) yielded by bioaerosol nebulizers when conducting BFE testing (i.e., a relatively high content of particles\u2009>\u20094\u00a0\u00b5m and\u2009<\u20091\u00a0\u00b5m even if the mean mode of the distribution ranges from 2\u20133\u00a0\u00b5m), the MAD should be a better parameter than the MPS for a more accurate intercomparison of BFE tests using different bioaerosol sources. Finally, adding a condition on the size polydispersity of the bioaerosol emitted by the source (e.g., a limit I term of the GSD or a maximum particle content of\u2009<\u20091.1\u00a0\u00b5m corresponding to stage 5 of the six-stage viable ACI) may be of value because the filtration efficiency of many masks often drops from a size below 1 \u00b5m,. This study provided new insights regarding BFE, which is a critical performance feature of medical face masks. Our work demonstrated the following:,Disposable 90-mm Petri dishes can be used instead of the 100-mm dishes supplied with the six-stage viable ACI.,Automatic HD colony counters can be used to directly count viable particles on collection substrates without requiring use of the positive-hole conversion table.,Automatic HD colony counters can be used to measure the MPS, but the positive-hole conversion table must be used to correct the data.,In summary, this important scientific input enables considering possible modernization of the outdated test methods recommended by the US and European standards on BFE measurements. Specifically, use of a modern colony counter should be regulated and permitted to avoid the drawbacks posed by visually counting the positive holes and using a conversion table to convert them into viable particles. In characterizing the particle size distribution of the bioaerosol generated, current recommendations of standards to calculate the MPS seem outdated, and the MAD seems more relevant than does the MPS for characterizing aerosol size using a lognormal distribution.", "2": "The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 led to death of millions of people worldwide. To stave off the spread of the virus, the authorities in the US employed different strategies, including the mask mandate order issued by the states\u2019 governors. In the current work, we defined a parameter called average death ratio as the monthly average of the number of daily deaths to the monthly average number of daily cases. We utilized survey data to quantify people\u2019s abidance by the mask mandate order. Additionally, we implicitly addressed the extent to which people abide by the mask mandate order,  which\u00a0may depend on some parameters such as population, income, and education level. Using different machine learning classification algorithms, we investigated how the decrease or increase in death ratio for the counties in the US West Coast correlates with the input parameters. The results showed that for the majority of counties, the mask mandate order decreased the death ratio, reflecting the effectiveness of such a preventive measure on the West Coast. Additionally, the changes in the death ratio demonstrated a noticeable correlation with the socio-economic condition of each county. Moreover, the results showed a promising classification accuracy score as high as 90%.", "3": "The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a surge in demand for facemasks to protect against disease transmission. In response to shortages, many public health authorities have recommended homemade masks as acceptable alternatives to surgical masks and N95 respirators. Although mask wearing is intended, in part, to protect others from exhaled, virus-containing particles, few studies have examined particle emission by mask-wearers into the surrounding air. Here, we measured outward emissions of micron-scale aerosol particles by healthy humans performing various expiratory activities while wearing different types of medical-grade or homemade masks. Both surgical masks and unvented KN95 respirators, even without fit-testing, reduce the outward particle emission rates by 90% and 74% on average during speaking and coughing, respectively, compared to wearing no mask, corroborating their effectiveness at reducing outward emission. These masks similarly decreased the outward particle emission of a coughing superemitter, who for unclear reasons emitted up to two orders of magnitude more expiratory particles via coughing than average. In contrast, shedding of non-expiratory micron-scale particulates from friable cellulosic fibers in homemade cotton-fabric masks confounded explicit determination of their efficacy at reducing expiratory particle emission. Audio analysis of the speech and coughing intensity confirmed that people speak more loudly, but do not cough more loudly, when wearing a mask. Further work is needed to establish the efficacy of cloth masks at blocking expiratory particles for speech and coughing at varied intensity and to assess whether virus-contaminated fabrics can generate aerosolized fomites, but the results strongly corroborate the efficacy of medical-grade masks and highlight the importance of regular washing of homemade masks. We recruited 10 volunteers (6 male and 4 female), ranging in age from 18 to 45\u00a0years old. The University of California Davis Institutional Review Board approved this study (IRB# 844,369\u20134), and all research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations of the Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the tests, and all participants were asked to provide their age, weight, height, general health status, and smoking history. Only participants who self-reported as healthy non-smokers were included in the study.,The general experimental setup used was similar to that in previous work,. In brief, an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS, TSI model 3321) was used to count the number of particles between 0.3 to 20\u00a0\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter; the APS counting efficiency falls off below\u2009~\u20090.5\u00a0\u00b5m, and thus the particles counted between 0.3 and 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m likely underestimate the true number. The APS was placed inside a HEPA-filtered laminar flow hood that minimizes background particle concentration (Fig.\u00a0,a). Study participants were asked to sit so that their mouth was positioned in front of a funnel attached to the APS inlet via a conductive silicone tube. They then performed different expiratory activities while wearing no mask or one of the masks shown in Fig.\u00a0,b and described in more detail below. A microphone was placed immediately on the side of the funnel to record the duration and intensity of talking and coughing activities (Fig.\u00a0,c). The participants were positioned with their mouth approximately 1\u00a0cm away from the funnel entrance; the nose rest used in our previous setup, was removed to prevent additional particle generation via rubbing of the mask fabric on the nose rest surface. The air was pulled in by the APS at 5 L/min, with 1 L/min (20%) focused into the detector to count and size the cumulative number of particles at 1-s intervals (Fig.\u00a0,d). Note that the funnel is a semi-confined environment, and not all expired particles were necessarily captured by the APS. The wearing of masks may redirect some of the expired airflow in non-outward directions (e.g., out the top or sides of the mask,). Accordingly, we use the terminology \u201coutward emission\u201d when referring the to the particle emissions measured here. Therefore, the measurements reported here do not represent the absolute number of emitted particles and may underestimate contributions from particles that escape out the sides of the masks, but do allow relative comparisons between different conditions. The particle emission rates reported here from the APS are likely smaller than the total expiratory particle emission rates by, approximately, the ratio of the exhaled volumetric flowrate that enters the funnel to the APS sample rate.,(,) Schematic of the experimental setup showing a participant wearing a mask in front of the funnel connected to the APS.

The subject gave her written informed consent for publication of the images in (,).,All experiments were performed with ambient temperature between 22 to 24\u00a0\u00b0C. The relative humidity ranged from 30 to 35% for most experiments; a second round of testing, comparing washed vs. unwashed homemade masks, was performed at 53% relative humidity. Given the approximately 3-s delay between entering the funnel and reaching the detector within the APS, under all these conditions the aqueous components of micron-scale respiratory droplets had more than sufficient time (i.e., more than\u2009~\u2009100\u00a0ms) to evaporate fully to their dried residual (so-called \u201cdroplet nuclei\u201d,); see figure S3 of Asadi et al., for direct experimental evidence of complete drying under these conditions. Although large droplets (>\u200920\u00a0\u00b5m) can require substantially more than 1\u00a0s to evaporate,, as shown here the vast majority of particles are less than 5\u00a0\u00b5m and thus unlikely to have originated at sizes larger than 20\u00a0\u00b5m. The size distributions presented here are based on the diameter as observed at the APS detector.,Participants were asked to complete four distinct activities for each mask or respirator type:,(i) ,: gentle breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth, for 2\u00a0min at a pace comfortable for the participant. The particle emission rate was calculated as the total number of particles emitted over the entire 2-min period, divided by two minutes to obtain the average particles per second.,(ii) ,: reading aloud the Rainbow Passage (Fairbanks, and Supplementary Text S1), a standard 330-word long linguistic text with a wide range of phonemes. Participants read this passage aloud at an intermediate, comfortable voice loudness. Since participants naturally read at a slightly different volume and pace, the microphone recording was used to calculate the root mean square (RMS) amplitude (as a measure of loudness) and duration of vocalization (excluding the pauses between the words). The particle emission rate was calculated as the total number of particles emitted over the entire reading (approximately 100 to 150\u00a0s), divided by the cumulative duration of vocalization excluding pauses. Excluding the pauses accounts for person-to-person differences in the fraction of time spent actively vocalizing while speaking (approximately 82%\u2009\u00b1\u20095%) so that individuals who simply pause longer between words are not characterized with an artificially low emission rate due to vocalization.,(iii) ,: Successive, forced coughing for 30\u00a0s at a comfortable rate and intensity for the participant. Similar to the talking experiment, the microphone data was used to determine the RMS amplitude of each cough, the number of coughs, and cumulative duration of coughing (excluding the pauses between the coughs). The particle emission rate was calculated as the total number of particles emitted during the 30\u00a0s of measurement, divided either by the number of coughs (to obtain particles/cough) or by the cumulative duration of the coughs (to obtain particles/s).,(iv) ,: moving the jaw as if chewing gum, without opening the mouth, for 1\u00a0min, while nose breathing, to test whether facial motion in the absence of more extreme expiration caused significant particle emission. This activity technically counts as an expiratory activity since the participant was nose breathing, but the main intent was to assess whether facial motion appreciably alters particle emission, due either to gentle friction between the skin and the facemask yielding enhanced particle emission, or variable gap distances between the mask and skin allowing more or less particles to escape. The particle emission rate was calculated as the total number of particles emitted over the 1-min period, divided by 60\u00a0s to obtain the average particles per second.,Participants completed each of the four expiratory activities when they wore no mask or one of the 6 different mask or respirator types:,(i) A surgical mask (ValuMax 5130E-SB) denoted as \u201cSurg.\u201d, tested by 10 participants.,(ii) An unvented KN95 respirator (GB2626-2006, manufacturer Nine Five Protection Technology, Dongguan, China), tested by 10 participants.,(iii) A homemade single-layer paper towel mask (Kirkland, 2-PLY sheet, 27.9\u00a0cm\u2009\u00d7\u200917.7\u00a0cm) denoted as \u201cSL-P\u201d and tested by 10 participants.,(iv) A homemade single-layer t-shirt mask, \u201cSL-T\u201d, made from a new cotton t-shirt (Calvin Klein Men\u2019s Liquid Cotton Polo, 100% cotton, item #1341469), tested by 10 participants.,(v) A homemade double-layer t-shirt mask, \u201cDL-T\u201d, made from the same t-shirt material as the SL-T mask, and tested by 10 participants.,(vi)A vented N95 respirator (NIOSH N95, Safety Plus, TC-84A-7448)) tested by 2 participants; shortages at the time of testing precluded a larger sample size. The primary difference between an N95 and KN95 respirator is where the mask is certified, in the US. (N95) or China (KN95).,The homemade cloth masks (SL-T, and DL-T) were made according to the CDC do-it-yourself instructions for single- and double-layer t-shirt masks,. The homemade paper towel masks were made according to do-it-yourself instructions,. Photographs of all mask types are shown in Fig.\u00a0,b.,Prior to wearing each mask, participants were verbally given general guidance on how to put on each mask. In the case of surgical masks and KN95 respirators they were instructed to pinch the metal bar to conform the mask to the nose. No fit-testing of respirators, as mandated by OSHA standard (29 CFR Part 1910),, was performed, with the intent of obtaining representative particle emission rates for untrained individuals without access to professional fitting assistance.,To test whether washing of the homemade cloth masks had any effect on the particle emission rate, a subset of 4 participants were asked to bring their double-layer t-shirt mask home and to hand-wash it with water and soap, rinse it thoroughly, and let it air-dry. These participants then returned and repeated the four activities with a brand-new DL-T mask and their washed DL-T mask to provide a direct comparison of washed versus unwashed fabric.,Besides the above experiments to measure the particle emission associated with different mask fabrics, we also performed a qualitative test of the friability of the masks by rubbing each mask by hand in front of the APS, using a procedure similar to that performed previously with paper tissues (cf. Figure\u00a0, of Asadi et al.,). Specifically, the mask was folded over on itself between thumb and index finger, and the mask material was rubbed against itself. A sample of each mask type was rubbed by hand by the same individual for 10\u00a0s in front of the APS, using to the best of their ability the same amount of force each time. The test was repeated 3 times for each mask type. The particle emission rate was calculated as the total number of particles emitted divided by the duration of rubbing (10\u00a0s). Note that this procedure does not preclude possible particle shedding from the skin of the experimentalist,; the observed particle emission rates for different mask materials therefore represent only qualitative indications of the relative friability.,Box-and-whisker plots show the median (red line), interquartile range (blue box), and range (black whiskers). Stata/IC 15 was used to perform Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test on the particle emission rates for each activity. After log-transformation of the data, mixed-effects linear regression was performed to account for person-level correlations. Considering that we had only one primary random effect (person-to-person variability), all variances were set equal with zero covariances. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed and adjusted for multiple comparisons using Scheffe\u2019s method. Scheffe groups are indicated with green letters below each box plot; groups with no common letter are considered significantly different (,\u2009<\u20090.05). Particle emission rates for the four expiratory activities are shown in Fig.\u00a0,. Focusing first on breathing (Fig.\u00a0,a), when participants wore no mask, the median particle emission rate was 0.31 particles/s, with one participant (M6) as high as 0.57 particles/s, and another participant (F3) as low as 0.05 particles/s. This median rate and person-to-person variability are both broadly consistent with previous studies,. In contrast, wearing a surgical mask or a KN95 respirator significantly reduced the outward number of particles emitted per second of breathing. The median outward emission rates for these masks were 0.06 and 0.07 particles/s, respectively, representing an approximately sixfold decrease compared to no mask. Wearing a homemade single layer paper towel (SL-P) mask yielded a similar decrease in outward emission rate, although not as statistically significant as the medical-grade masks.,Particle emission rates associated with (,) breathing, (,) talking, (,) coughing, and (,) jaw movement when participants wore no mask or when they wore one of the six mask types considered. Scheffe groups are indicated with green letters; groups with no common letter are considered significantly different (,\u2009<\u20090.05). Surg.: surgical; KN95: unvented KN95; SL-P: single-layer paper towel; U-SL-T: unwashed single-layer cotton t-shirt; U-DL-T: unwashed double-layer cotton t-shirt; N95: vented N95. Note that the scales are logarithmic and the orders of magnitude differ in each subplot.,Surprisingly, wearing an unwashed single layer t-shirt (U-SL-T) mask while breathing yielded a significant increase in measured particle emission rates compared to no mask, increasing to a median of 0.61 particles/s. The rates for some participants (F1 and F4) exceeded 1 particle/s, representing a 384% increase from the median no-mask value. Wearing a double-layer cotton t-shirt (U-DL-T) mask had no statistically significant effect on the particle emission rate, with comparable median and range to that observed with no mask.,Turning to speech (Fig.\u00a0,b), the overarching trend observed is that vocalization at an intermediate, comfortable voice loudness (Figure ,a and Table ,) yielded an order of magnitude more particles than breathing. When participants wore no mask and spoke, the median rate was 2.77 particles/s (compared to 0.31 for breathing). The general trend of the mask type effect on the particle emission was qualitatively similar to that observed for breathing. Wearing surgical masks and KN95 respirators while talking significantly decreased the outward emission by an order of magnitude, to median rates of 0.18 and 0.36 particles/s, respectively. Likewise, wearing the paper towel mask reduced the outward speech particle emission rate to 1.21 particles/s, lower than no mask but representing a less pronounced decrease compared to surgical masks and KN95 respirators. In contrast, the homemade cloth masks again yielded either no change or a significant increase in emission rate during speech compared to no mask. The outward particle emissions when participants wore U-SL-T masks exceeded the no-mask condition by an order of magnitude with a median value of 16.37 particles/s. Wearing the U-DL-T mask had no significant effect.,The third expiratory activity \u2013 coughing \u2013 again yielded qualitatively similar trends with respect to mask type (Fig.\u00a0,c). We emphasize that participants coughed at different paces, and therefore the number of coughs, cumulative cough duration, and acoustic power varied between participants (Figure ,b, Figure S2, and Table S2). Nonetheless, we observe that coughing with no mask produced a median of 10.1 particles/s, with most participants in the range of 3 to 42 particles/s. For comparison, given a coughing rate of 6 times per minute, the median outward particle count due specifically to coughing over that minute is slightly smaller than that from breathing, and an order of magnitude smaller than talking over a minute (see Fig. S3 for equivalent numbers of particles per cough). Similar general trends as for breathing and speaking were observed for coughing when wearing the different mask types. The surgical mask decreased the median outward emission rate to 2.44 particles/s (75% decrease), while the KN95 yielded an apparent but not statistically significant decrease to 6.15 particles/s (39% decrease). The SL-P mask yielded no statistically significant difference compared to no mask. In contrast, the homemade U-SL-T and U-DL-T masks however yielded a significant increase in outward particle emission per second (or per cough) compared to no mask, with median emission rates of 49.2 and 36.1 particles/s, respectively.,Notably, one individual, M6, emitted up to two orders of magnitude more aerosol particles while coughing than the others, emitting 567 particles/s with no mask.\u00a0Even when M6 wore a surgical mask he emitted 19.5 particles/s while coughing, substantially above the median value for no mask, although still a substantial decrease compared to no mask for this individual. Acoustic analysis of the coughing, both in terms of the root mean square amplitude (Figure ,b) and the filtered power density, indicate that the coughs by M6 were not particularly louder nor more energetic than the others (see Figure S2 and Table S2). It is unclear what caused this individual to emit a factor of 100 more aerosol particles than average while coughing, although qualitatively, the coughs of M6 appeared to originate more from the chest, compared to other participants for whom coughs generally appeared to originate more from the throat; notably, this individual emitted a much closer to average amount of particles while speaking and breathing. Furthermore, the significantly higher aerosol particle emission compared to average during coughing for M6 persisted regardless of the mask type.,Finally, Fig.\u00a0,d shows the particle emission rate when participants moved their jaw, similar to chewing gum with their mouth closed, while only breathing through their nose. In general, jaw movement with nose breathing and no mask produced slightly fewer particles per second than the breathing activity (breathing in through nose and out through mouth), with a median rate of 0.12 particles/s for no mask. As participants were still breathing with closed mouth during the jaw movement, the lower particle production likely results from participants exhaling through the nose rather than through the mouth,. Wearing a surgical mask or KN95 respirator had no statistically significant effect on particle emission from jaw movement compared to no mask. In contrast, wearing all other types of homemade masks (SL-P, U-SL-T, and U-DL-T) substantially increased the particle emission rate, with the single-layer mask yielding the most at 1.72 particles/s.,All of the above experiments were also repeated with vented N95 respirators, albeit with only 2 participants (due to shortages at the time of testing). The small sample size precludes significance testing, but in general the particle emission rates of the two tested were comparable to the surgical mask and unvented KN95 in terms of reduction in the overall emission rates.,The emission rates presented in Fig.\u00a0, represent the total for all particles in the size range 0.3 to 20\u00a0\u00b5m. We also measured the corresponding size distributions in terms of overall fraction for all trials (Fig.\u00a0,). In general, all size distributions observed here were lognormal, with a peak somewhere near 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m and decaying rapidly to negligible fractions above 5\u00a0\u00b5m. Breathing while wearing no mask emitted particles with a geometric mean diameter of 0.65\u00a0\u00b5m (Fig.\u00a0,a), with 35% of the particles in the smallest size range of 0.3 to 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m. Regardless of the mask type, wearing masks while breathing significantly increased this fraction of particles in the smallest size range (e.g., to as high as 60% for KN95 respirator), shifting the geometric mean diameter toward smaller sizes. Talking with no mask yielded slightly larger particles compared to breathing, with mean diameter of 0.75\u00a0\u00b5m (Fig.\u00a0,b). Wearing a mask while talking affected the size distribution in a qualitatively similar manner to that observed with breathing, in that a higher fraction of particles were in the smallest size range. Unlike breathing however, the U-SL-T and U-DL-T masks released the highest fractions of small particles (47% and 51%, respectively).,Observed particle size distributions, normalized by particles/s per bin, associated with (,) breathing, (,) talking, (,) coughing, and (,) jaw movement when participants wore no mask or one of the five mask types considered. Each curve is the average over all 10 participants. The solid lines represent the data using a ,-point smoothing function. Data points with horizontal error bars show the small particles ranging from 0.3 to 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter detected by APS with no further information about their size distribution in this range. Surg.: surgical; KN95: unvented KN95; SL-P: single-layer paper towel; U-SL-T: unwashed single-layer cotton t-shirt; U-DL-T: unwashed double-layer cotton t-shirt; N95: vented N95.,The effect of wearing a mask was more pronounced on the size distribution of the particles produced by coughing (Fig.\u00a0,c). For no mask, the mean diameter of cough-generated particles was 0.6\u00a0\u00b5m. The majority of particles emitted were in the smallest size range (up to 57%) during coughing while wearing homemade masks (SL-P, U-SL-T, and U-DL-T). We also note that for coughing, which produced the highest rates of particle emission for of all expiratory activities tested, wearing homemade masks considerably reduced the fraction of large particles (>\u20090.8\u00a0\u00b5m). Finally, for jaw movement the overall size distributions for no-mask and with-mask cases were similar except that the fraction of smallest particles was lowest for no-mask and the surgical mask (Fig.\u00a0,d).,To provide a direct comparison of the efficacy of medical-grade and homemade masks in mitigating the emission of particles of different sizes, we divided the entire size range measured by APS (0.3 \u2013 20\u00a0\u00b5m) into three sub-ranges (smallest, 0.3 \u2013 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m; intermediate, 0.5 \u2013 1\u00a0\u00b5m; and largest, 1 \u2013 20\u00a0\u00b5m), and calculated the corresponding percent change in the median particle emission rate of each sub-range during breathing, talking, and coughing compared to no mask (Fig.\u00a0,). For the smallest particles, Fig.\u00a0,a shows that up to a 92% reduction in 0.3 \u2013 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m particle emission rate occurred while wearing surgical and KN95 masks for breathing, talking, and coughing, with the KN95 yielding a smaller decrease of 20.5% in this size range. The SL-P mask caused a 60% reduction in 0.3 \u2013 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m particle emission for talking and breathing, but yielded a 77% increase for coughing. The least effective masks in terms of minimizing emissions of the smallest particles were the U-SL-T and U-DL-T masks, with U-SL-T substantially increasing the emission of 0.3 \u2013 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m particles by almost 600% for speech, and the U-DL-T mask yielding very slight changes for talking and breathing and an almost 300% increase for coughing. Qualitatively similar trends were observed for intermediate size particles in the range of 0.5 \u2013 1\u00a0\u00b5m (Fig.\u00a0,b), with the medical-grade masks yielding significant reductions. The main difference for this size range is that the SL-P mask yielded a 15.7% decrease in particle emissions for coughing, and the U-DL-T mask provided up to 34.1% reduction in particle emissions for breathing and talking.,Percent change in median particle emission rate (N) for 10 participants compared to no-mask median, while wearing different mask types and while breathing (blue points), talking (red points), or coughing (green points), for particles in the following size ranges: (,) smallest, 0.3\u20130.5\u00a0\u00b5m; (,) intermediate, 0.5\u20131\u00a0\u00b5m; (,) largest, 1\u201320\u00a0\u00b5m; and (,) all sizes, 0.3\u201320\u00a0\u00b5m. The dashed lines are to guide the eye. Surg.: surgical; KN95: unvented KN95; SL-P: single-layer paper towel; U-SL-T: unwashed single-layer cotton t-shirt; U-DL-T: unwashed double-layer cotton t-shirt.,As for the largest particle sizes (1 \u2013 20\u00a0\u00b5m), the observed trends were again qualitatively similar to the intermediate particles (Fig.\u00a0,c), with the medical-grade masks yielding large reductions. Notably, the U-DL-T mask emitted much fewer large particles for breathing and talking with approximately 60% reductions, but still a sizable 160% increase for coughing. The percent change in median particle emission over the entire size range of 0.3 \u2013 20\u00a0\u00b5m is presented in Fig.\u00a0,d, which shows that the homemade masks in general yielded more particles in total for coughing, and had mixed efficacy in reducing particle emissions for breathing and talking. The key point is that the surgical and KN95 masks effectively decreased the particle emission for all expiratory activities tested here over the entire range of particle sizes measured by the APS.,To help interpret our findings we also quantified the particles emitted from manual rubbing of mask fabrics. The results (Fig.\u00a0,a) show that, in the absence of any expiratory activity, rubbing a surgical mask fabric generated on average 1.5 particles per second, while KN95 and N95 respirators produced fewer than 1 particle per second. In contrast, rubbing the homemade paper and cotton masks aerosolized significant number of particles, with the highest values for SL-P (8.0 particles/s) and U-SL-T (7.2 particles/s) masks. Intriguingly, we found that the size distribution of the particles aerosolized from homemade mask fabrics via manual rubbing (Fig.\u00a0,b) was qualitatively different from when participants wore the same masks to perform expiratory activities. An extra peak appeared at approximately 6\u00a0\u00b5m and the fraction of small particles dropped to below 27%, suggesting that the frictional forces of fibers against fibers helped fragment and dislodge larger particulates into the air. Importantly, however, manual rubbing produced a sizeable number of particulates in the size range of 0.3 to 2\u00a0\u00b5m, commensurate with the range observed while the masks were worn during expiratory activities. Note that the coarse skin particulates (>\u20092\u00a0\u00b5m) released from hand during the mask fabric rubbing experiments could have contributed to the observed particle counts,. However, since this factor was the same in all the manual rubbing experiments, and only facemask fabrics differed, it is difficult to explain the observed trends solely in terms of friction between skin and mask fabrics. Moreover, although in these experiments the applied tribological force was not strictly controlled or quantified, the presented results strongly suggest that cotton fabric masks have much more friable material, consistent with our observation that more particles are emitted when participants perform expiratory activities in those cotton fabric masks.,(,) Number of particles emitted per second of manual rubbing for all masks tested. Each data point is time-averaged particle emission rate over 10\u00a0s of rubbing. (,) Corresponding size distribution for homemade paper and cotton masks for a total of 30\u00a0s of manual rubbing in front of the APS. The solid lines represent the data using a ,-point smoothing function. Data points with horizontal whiskers show the small particles ranging from 0.3 to 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter detected by APS. Surg.: surgical; KN95: unvented KN95; SL-P: single-layer paper towel; U-SL-T: unwashed single-layer cotton t-shirt; U-DL-T: unwashed double-layer cotton t-shirt; N95: vented N95.,Since the cotton masks were all prepared from fabric that was brand new and unwashed, as a final test we hypothesized that perhaps washing the masks would remove surface-bound dust and otherwise friable material and decrease the emission rate. Our experiments do not corroborate this hypothesis. Handwashing the double-layer t-shirt mask with soap and water followed by air-drying yielded no significant change in the particle emission rate as compared to the original unwashed masks (Fig. ,). Moreover, manual rubbing of a washed double-layer cotton mask aerosolized slightly more particles than the unwashed mask. These results suggest that a single washing has little impact on the presence of aerosolizable particulate matter in standard cotton fabrics. Note also that the ranges observed here accord qualitatively with the prior measurements taken with the same 4 participants on a previous day (compare the results for each category in Fig.\u00a0, versus the U-DL-T columns for the respective expiratory activities in Fig.\u00a0,). This observation suggests that day-to-day variability for a given individual is less than the person-to-person variability observed for all expiratory activities and mask types tested.,Particle emission rate from breathing, talking, coughing and jaw movement for 4 participants wearing unwashed or washed double-layer t-shirt masks (U-DL-T vs. W-DL-T). Last column shows the particles emission rates for manual rubbing of washed and unwashed masks (three 10-s trials for each mask). Our results clearly indicate that wearing surgical masks or unvented KN95 respirators reduce the outward particle emission rates by 90% and 74% on average during speaking and coughing, respectively, compared to wearing no mask. However, for the homemade cotton masks, the measured particle emission rate either remained unchanged (DL-T) or increased by as much as 492% (SL-T) compared to no mask for all of the expiratory activities. For jaw movement, the particle emission rates for homemade paper and cloth masks were an order of magnitude larger than that of no mask (Fig.\u00a0,d). These observations, along with our results from manual mask rubbing experiments (Fig.\u00a0,), provide strong evidence of substantial shedding of non-expiratory micron-scale particulates from friable cellulosic fibers of the paper and cloth masks owing to mechanical action,. The higher particle emission rate for jaw movement than for breathing is an indication of greater frictional shedding of the paper towel and cotton masks during jaw movement compared to breathing, at least as tested here. Likewise, the difference in the size distributions of mask rubbing and with-mask expiratory activities is likely due to the vigorous frictional force applied by hand on the masks. Regardless of the larger particles (>\u20095\u00a0\u00b5m), rubbing mask fabrics generates a considerable number of particles in the range of 0.3\u20135\u00a0\u00b5m similar to that observed for the expiratory activities. This finding corroborates the interpretation that some proportion of the particulates observed during expiration were particulates aerosolized from the masks themselves.,Another factor to consider is that masks can reduce the intelligibility of the speech signal,, and can reduce the intensity of sounds passed through them by a significant amount (e.g.,\u2009>\u200910\u00a0dB in Saedi et al.,). Likely as a response to this, people will speak louder and otherwise adjust their speech when wearing masks. Mendel et al., found that the measured intensity of speech was approximately the same for a group of speakers with and without surgical masks, suggesting that speakers increased the actual intensity of their speech when wearing masks. Fecher, found that speakers will actually produce louder output through some types of masks in cases where they overestimate the dampening effects of the mask. It is also possible that speakers may produce Lombard speech when wearing certain types of masks,. Lombard speech is louder, has a higher fundamental frequency, and tends to have longer vowel durations, all characteristics that may contribute to an increase in the emission of aerosols,. Our results showed that the root mean square amplitude of speech, as measured externally when participants wore any type of mask, equaled or exceeded that of the no-mask condition (Figure ,a), suggesting that participants were indeed talking louder with the mask. Although an increase in the intensity of the speech signal when wearing masks would result in greater output of particles in these conditions,, the difference in the intensity of speech across the different conditions was not very large (Figure ,a). As a result, this mechanism alone cannot explain the increased particle output in some of the masked conditions. Intriguingly, the root mean square amplitude of coughing decreased for most of the participants after they wore a type of mask (Figure ,b), suggesting that they do not cough louder when they wear a mask, i.e., there is no Lombard effect for coughing.,The substantial particle shedding by the cloth masks confounds determination of the cloth mask efficacy for reducing outward emission of particles produced from the expiratory activity. Measured material filtration efficiencies vary widely for different cloth materials,. The influence of particle shedding on such determinations has not been previously considered; our results raise the possibility that particle shedding has led to underestimated material filtration efficiencies for certain materials. While the material efficiency of the cotton masks was not determined here, we note that the use of the double-layer cotton masks reduced the emission of larger particles (both on a normalized and absolute basis), indicating some reasonable efficacy towards reduction of the expiratory particle emission. Further work differentiating between expiratory and shed particles, possibly based on composition, can help establish the specific efficacy of the cloth masks towards expiratory particles. That the masks shed fibers from mechanical stimulation indicates care must be taken when removing and cleaning (for reusable masks) potentially contaminated masks so as to not dislodge deposited micro-organisms.,We also note that the emission reduction due to surgical masks was greater than the corresponding reduction due to KN95 respirators, although this difference was only significant for coughing (p\u2009<\u20090.05). That the surgical masks appear to provide slightly greater reduction than the KN95 respirators is perhaps surprising, as KN95s are commonly thought of as providing more protection than surgical masks for inhalation. Both surgical masks and KN95 respirators typically have high material filtration efficiencies (>\u200995%),, although the quality of surgical masks can vary substantially,. The fit of surgical and KN95 respirators differs substantially. Here, no fit tests were performed to ensure good seals of the KN95 respirators. It may be that imperfect fitting of KN95 respirators allows for greater escape of particles from the mask-covered environment compared to the more flexible surgical masks. Regardless, all surgical masks, KN95 and N95 respirators tested here provided substantial reduction of particle emission compared to no mask.,A particularly important observation was the existence of a coughing superemitter, who for unknown reasons emitted two orders of magnitude more particles during coughing than average (Fig.\u00a0,c, red points for M6). This huge difference persisted regardless of mask type, with even the most effective mask, the surgical mask, only reducing the rate to a value twice the median value for no mask at all. Although the underlying mechanism leading to such enhanced particle\u00a0emission is unclear, these observations nonetheless confirm that some people act as superemitters during coughing, similar to \u201cspeech superemitters\u201d,, and \u201cbreathing high producers\u201d,. This observation raises the possibility that coughing superemitters could serve as superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease. Notably, the coughing superemitter was not a breathing superemitter or speaking superemitter, indicating that testing only one type of expiratory activity might not necessarily identify superemitters for other expiratory activities.,As a final comment, we emphasize that here we only measured the physical dynamics of outward aerosol particle emission for different expiratory activities and mask types. Redirected expiratory airflow, involving exhaled air moving up past the nose or out the side of the mask, were not measured here but should be considered in future work. Likewise, more sophisticated biological techniques are necessary to gauge mask efficacy at blocking emission of viable pathogens. Our work does raise the possibility, however, that virus-contaminated masks could release aerosolized fomites into the air by shedding fiber particulates from the mask fabric. Since mask efficacy experiments are typically only conducted with fresh, not used, masks, future work assessing emission of viable pathogens should consider this possibility in more detail. Our work also raises questions about whether homemade masks using other fabrics, such as polyester, might be more efficient than cotton in terms of blocking expiratory particles while minimizing shedding of fabric particulates, and whether repeated washings might affect homemade masks. Future experiments using controlled bursts of clean air through the masks will help to resolve the source of these non-expiratory particles. Nonetheless, as a precaution, our results suggest that individuals using homemade fabric masks should take care to wash or otherwise sterilize them on a regular basis to minimize the possibility of emission of aerosolized fomites. These observations directly demonstrate that wearing of surgical masks or KN95 respirators, even without fit-testing, substantially reduce the number of particles emitted from breathing, talking, and coughing. While the efficacy of cloth and paper masks is not as clear and confounded by shedding of mask fibers, the observations indicate it is likely that they provide some reductions in emitted expiratory particles, in particular the larger particles (>\u20090.5\u00a0\u03bcm). We have not directly measured virus emission; nonetheless, our results strongly imply that mask wearing will reduce emission of virus-laden aerosols and droplets associated with expiratory activities, unless appreciable shedding of viable viruses on mask fibers occurs. The majority of the particles emitted were in the aerosol range (<\u20095\u00a0\u03bcm). As inertial impaction should increase as particle size increases, it seems likely that the emission reductions observed here provide a lower bound for the reduction of particles in the droplet range (>\u20095\u00a0\u03bcm). Our observations are consistent with suggestions that mask wearing can help in mitigating pandemics associated with respiratory disease. Our results highlight the importance of regular changing of disposable masks and washing of homemade masks, and suggests that special care must be taken when removing and cleaning the masks.", "4": "We identified seasonal human coronaviruses, influenza viruses and rhinoviruses in exhaled breath and coughs of children and adults with acute respiratory illness. Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets. Our results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals. Respiratory virus infections cause a broad and overlapping spectrum of symptoms collectively referred to as acute respiratory virus illnesses (ARIs) or more commonly the \u2018common cold\u2019. Although mostly mild, these ARIs can sometimes cause severe disease and death,. These viruses spread between humans through direct or indirect contact, respiratory droplets (including larger droplets that fall rapidly near the source as well as coarse aerosols with aerodynamic diameter >5\u2009\u00b5m) and fine-particle aerosols (droplets and droplet nuclei with aerodynamic diameter \u22645\u2009\u00b5m),. Although hand hygiene and use of face masks, primarily targeting contact and respiratory droplet transmission, have been suggested as important mitigation strategies against influenza virus transmission,, little is known about the relative importance of these modes in the transmission of other common respiratory viruses,. Uncertainties similarly apply to the modes of transmission of COVID-19 (refs. ,).,Some health authorities recommend that masks be worn by ill individuals to prevent onward transmission (source control),. Surgical face masks were originally introduced to protect patients from wound infection and contamination from surgeons (the wearer) during surgical procedures, and were later adopted to protect healthcare workers against acquiring infection from their patients. However, most of the existing evidence on the filtering efficacy of face masks and respirators comes from in vitro experiments with nonbiological particles,, which may not be generalizable to infectious respiratory virus droplets. There is little information on the efficacy of face masks in filtering respiratory viruses and reducing viral release from an individual with respiratory infections,, and most research has focused on influenza,.,Here we aimed to explore the importance of respiratory droplet and aerosol routes of transmission with a particular focus on coronaviruses, influenza viruses and rhinoviruses, by quantifying the amount of respiratory virus in exhaled breath of participants with medically attended ARIs and determining the potential efficacy of surgical face masks to prevent respiratory virus transmission. We screened 3,363 individuals in two study phases, ultimately enrolling 246 individuals who provided exhaled breath samples (Extended Data Fig. ,). Among these 246 participants, 122 (50%) participants were randomized to not wearing a face mask during the first exhaled breath collection and 124 (50%) participants were randomized to wearing a face mask. Overall, 49 (20%) voluntarily provided a second exhaled breath collection of the alternate type.,Infections by at least one respiratory virus were confirmed by reverse transcription PCR (RT\u2013PCR) in 123 of 246 (50%) participants. Of these 123 participants, 111 (90%) were infected by human (seasonal) coronavirus (,\u2009=\u200917), influenza virus (,\u2009=\u200943) or rhinovirus (,\u2009=\u200954) (Extended Data Figs. , and ,), including one participant co-infected by both coronavirus and influenza virus and another two participants co-infected by both rhinovirus and influenza virus. These 111 participants were the focus of our analyses.,There were some minor differences in characteristics of the 111 participants with the different viruses (Table ,). Overall, 24% of participants had a measured fever \u226537.8\u2009\u00b0C, with patients with influenza more than twice as likely than patients infected with coronavirus and rhinovirus to have a measured fever. Coronavirus-infected participants coughed the most with an average of 17 (s.d.\u2009=\u200930) coughs during the 30-min exhaled breath collection. The profiles of the participants randomized to with-mask versus without-mask groups were similar (Supplementary Table ,).,We tested viral shedding (in terms of viral copies per sample) in nasal swabs, throat swabs, respiratory droplet samples and aerosol samples and compared the latter two between samples collected with or without a face mask (Fig. ,). On average, viral shedding was higher in nasal swabs than in throat swabs for each of coronavirus (median 8.1 log, virus copies per sample versus 3.9), influenza virus (6.7 versus 4.0) and rhinovirus (6.8 versus 3.3), respectively. Viral RNA was identified from respiratory droplets and aerosols for all three viruses, including 30%, 26% and 28% of respiratory droplets and 40%, 35% and 56% of aerosols collected while not wearing a face mask, from coronavirus, influenza virus and rhinovirus-infected participants, respectively (Table ,). In particular for coronavirus, we identified OC43 and HKU1 from both respiratory droplets and aerosols, but only identified NL63 from aerosols and not from respiratory droplets (Supplementary Table , and Extended Data Fig. ,).,\u2013,, Virus copies per sample collected in nasal swab (red), throat swab (blue) and respiratory droplets collected for 30min while not wearing (dark green) or wearing (light green) a surgical face mask, and aerosols collected for 30min while not wearing (brown) or wearing (orange) a face mask, collected from individuals with acute respiratory symptoms who were positive for coronavirus (,), influenza virus (,) and rhinovirus (,), as determined by RT\u2013PCR in any samples. , values for mask intervention as predictor of log, virus copies per sample in an unadjusted univariate Tobit regression model which allowed for censoring at the lower limit of detection of the RT\u2013PCR assay are shown, with significant differences in bold. For nasal swabs and throat swabs, all infected individuals were included (coronavirus, ,=17; influenza virus, ,=43; rhinovirus, ,=54). For respiratory droplets and aerosols, numbers of infected individuals who provided exhaled breath samples while not wearing or wearing a surgical face mask, respectively were: coronavirus (,=10 and 11), influenza virus (,=23 and 28) and rhinovirus (,=36 and 32). A subset of participants provided exhaled breath samples for both mask interventions (coronavirus, ,=4; influenza virus, ,=8; rhinovirus, ,=14). The box plots indicate the median with the interquartile range (lower and upper hinge) and \u00b11.5\u00d7interquartile range from the first and third quartile (lower and upper whiskers).,We detected coronavirus in respiratory droplets and aerosols in 3 of 10 (30%) and 4 of 10 (40%) of the samples collected without face masks, respectively, but did not detect any virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols collected from participants wearing face masks, this difference was significant in aerosols and showed a trend toward reduced detection in respiratory droplets (Table ,). For influenza virus, we detected virus in 6 of 23 (26%) and 8 of 23 (35%) of the respiratory droplet and aerosol samples collected without face masks, respectively. There was a significant reduction by wearing face masks to 1 of 27 (4%) in detection of influenza virus in respiratory droplets, but no significant reduction in detection in aerosols (Table ,). Moreover, among the eight participants who had influenza virus detected by RT\u2013PCR from without-mask aerosols, five were tested by viral culture and four were culture-positive. Among the six participants who had influenza virus detected by RT\u2013PCR from with-mask aerosols, four were tested by viral culture and two were culture-positive. For rhinovirus, there were no significant differences between detection of virus with or without face masks, both in respiratory droplets and in aerosols (Table ,). Conclusions were similar in comparisons of viral shedding (Table ,). In addition, we found a significant reduction in viral shedding (Supplementary Table ,) in respiratory droplets for OC43 (Extended Data Fig. ,) and influenza B virus (Extended Data Fig. ,) and in aerosols for NL63 (Extended Data Fig. ,).,We identified correlations between viral loads in different samples (Extended Data Figs. ,\u2013,) and some evidence of declines in viral shedding by time since onset for influenza virus but not for coronavirus or rhinovirus (Extended Data Fig. ,). In univariable analyses of factors associated with detection of respiratory viruses in various sample types, we did not identify significant association in viral shedding with days since symptom onset (Supplementary Table ,) for respiratory droplets or aerosols (Supplementary Tables ,\u2013,).,A subset of participants (72 of 246, 29%) did not cough at all during at least one exhaled breath collection, including 37 of 147 (25%) during the without-mask and 42 of 148 (28%) during the with-mask breath collection. In the subset for coronavirus (,\u2009=\u20094), we did not detect any virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols from any participants. In the subset for influenza virus (,\u2009=\u20099), we detected virus in aerosols but not respiratory droplets from one participant. In the subset for rhinovirus (,\u2009=\u200917), we detected virus in respiratory droplets from three participants, and we detected virus in aerosols in five participants. Our results indicate that aerosol transmission is a potential mode of transmission for coronaviruses as well as influenza viruses and rhinoviruses. Published studies detected respiratory viruses, such as influenza, and rhinovirus, from exhaled breath, and the detection of SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, from air samples (without size fractionation) collected from hospitals treating patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but ours demonstrates detection of human seasonal coronaviruses in exhaled breath, including the detection of OC43 and HKU1 from respiratory droplets and NL63, OC43 and HKU1 from aerosols.,Our findings indicate that surgical masks can efficaciously reduce the emission of influenza virus particles into the environment in respiratory droplets, but not in aerosols,. Both the previous and current study used a bioaerosol collecting device, the Gesundheit-II (G-II),, to capture exhaled breath particles and differentiated them into two size fractions, where exhaled breath coarse particles >5\u2009\u03bcm (respiratory droplets) were collected by impaction with a 5-\u03bcm slit inertial Teflon impactor and the remaining fine particles \u22645\u2009\u03bcm (aerosols) were collected by condensation in buffer. We also demonstrated the efficacy of surgical masks to reduce coronavirus detection and viral copies in large respiratory droplets and in aerosols (Table ,). This has important implications for control of COVID-19, suggesting that surgical face masks could be used by ill people to reduce onward transmission.,Among the samples collected without a face mask, we found that the majority of participants with influenza virus and coronavirus infection did not shed detectable virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols, whereas for rhinovirus we detected virus in aerosols in 19 of 34 (56%) participants (compared to 4 of 10 (40%) for coronavirus and 8 of 23 (35%) for influenza). For those who did shed virus in respiratory droplets and aerosols, viral load in both tended to be low (Fig. ,). Given the high collection efficiency of the G-II (ref. ,) and given that each exhaled breath collection was conducted for 30\u2009min, this might imply that prolonged close contact would be required for transmission to occur, even if transmission was primarily via aerosols, as has been described for rhinovirus colds,. Our results also indicate that there could be considerable heterogeneity in contagiousness of individuals with coronavirus and influenza virus infections.,The major limitation of our study was the large proportion of participants with undetectable viral shedding in exhaled breath for each of the viruses studied. We could have increased the sampling duration beyond 30\u2009min to increase the viral shedding being captured, at the cost of acceptability in some participants. An alternative approach would be to invite participants to perform forced coughs during exhaled breath collection,. However, it was the aim of our present study to focus on recovering respiratory virus in exhaled breath in a real-life situation and we expected that some individuals during an acute respiratory illness would not cough much or at all. Indeed, we identified virus RNA in a small number of participants who did not cough at all during the 30-min exhaled breath collection, which would suggest droplet and aerosol routes of transmission are possible from individuals with no obvious signs or symptoms. Another limitation is that we did not confirm the infectivity of coronavirus or rhinovirus detected in exhaled breath. While the G-II was designed to preserve viability of viruses in aerosols, and in the present study we were able to identify infectious influenza virus in aerosols, we did not attempt to culture coronavirus or rhinovirus from the corresponding aerosol samples. Participants were recruited year-round from March 2013 through May 2016 in a general outpatient clinic of a private hospital in Hong Kong. As routine practice, clinic staff screened all individuals attending the clinics for respiratory and any other symptoms regardless of the purpose of the visit at triage. Study staff then approached immediately those who reported at least one of the following symptoms of ARI for further screening: fever \u226537.8\u2009\u00b0C, cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache, myalgia and phlegm. Individuals who reported \u22652 ARI symptoms, within 3\u2009d of illness onset and \u226511 years of age were eligible to participate. After explaining the study to and obtaining informed consent from the participants, a rapid influenza diagnostic test, the Sofia Influenza A\u2009+\u2009B Fluorescent Immunoassay Analyzer (cat. no. 20218, Quidel), was used to identify influenza A or B virus infection as an incentive to participate. All participants provided a nasal swab for the rapid test and an additional nasal swab and a separate throat swab for subsequent virologic confirmation at the laboratory. All participants also completed a questionnaire to record basic information including age, sex, symptom severity, medication, medical conditions and smoking history. In the first phase of the study from March 2013 to February 2014 (\u2018Influenza Study\u2019), the result of the rapid test was used to determine eligibility for further participation in the study and exhaled breath collection, whereas in the second phase of the study from March 2014 to May 2016 (\u2018Respiratory Virus Study\u2019), the rapid test did not affect eligibility. Eligible participants were then invited to provide an exhaled breath sample for 30\u2009min in the same clinic visit.,Before exhaled breath collection, each participant was randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either wearing a surgical face mask (cat. no. 62356, Kimberly-Clark) or not during the collection. To mimic the real-life situation, under observation by the study staff, participants were asked to attach the surgical mask themselves, but instruction on how to wear the mask properly was given when the participant wore the mask incorrectly. Participants were instructed to breathe as normal during the collection, but (natural) coughing was allowed and the number of coughs was recorded by study staff. Participants were then invited to provide a second exhaled breath sample of the alternate type (for example if the participant was first assigned to wearing a mask they would then provide a second sample without a mask), but most participants did not agree to stay for a second measurement because of time constraints. Participants were compensated for each 30-min exhaled breath collection with a supermarket coupon worth approximately US$30 and all participants were gifted a tympanic thermometer worth approximately US$20.,Written informed consent was obtained from all participants \u226518 years of age and written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of participants 11\u201317 years of age in addition to their own written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong and the Clinical and Research Ethics Committee of Hong Kong Baptist Hospital.,Nasal swabs and throat swabs were collected separately, placed in virus transport medium, stored and transported to the laboratory at 2\u20138\u2009\u00b0C and the virus transport medium was aliquoted and stored at \u221270\u2009\u00b0C until further analysis. Exhaled breath particles were captured and differentiated into two size fractions, the coarse fraction containing particles with aerodynamic diameter >5\u2009\u03bcm (referred to here as \u2018respiratory droplets\u2019), which included droplets up to approximately 100\u2009\u00b5m in diameter and the fine fraction with particles \u22645\u2009\u03bcm (referred to here as \u2018aerosols\u2019) by the G-II bioaerosol collecting device,. In the G-II device, exhaled breath coarse particles >5\u2009\u03bcm were collected by a 5-\u03bcm slit inertial Teflon impactor and the remaining fine particles \u22645\u2009\u03bcm were condensed and collected into approximately 170\u2009ml of 0.1% BSA/PBS. Both the impactor and the condensate were stored and transported to the laboratory at 2\u20138\u2009\u00b0C. The virus on the impactor was recovered into 1\u2009ml and the condensate was concentrated into 2\u2009ml of 0.1% BSA/PBS, aliquoted and stored at \u221270\u2009\u00b0C until further analysis. In a validation study, the G-II was able to recover over 85% of fine particles >0.05\u2009\u00b5m in size and had comparable collection efficiency of influenza virus as the SKC BioSampler,.,Samples collected from the two studies were tested at the same time. Nasal swab samples were first tested by a diagnostic-use viral panel, xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (Abbott Molecular) to qualitatively detect 12 common respiratory viruses and subtypes including coronaviruses (NL63, OC43, 229E and HKU1), influenza A (nonspecific, H1 and H3) and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus (types 1\u20134), adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and enterovirus/rhinovirus. After one or more of the candidate respiratory viruses was detected by the viral panel from the nasal swab, all the samples from the same participant (nasal swab, throat swab, respiratory droplets and aerosols) were then tested with RT\u2013PCR specific for the candidate virus(es) for determination of virus concentration in the samples. Infectious influenza virus was identified by viral culture using MDCK cells as described previously,, whereas viral culture was not performed for coronavirus and rhinovirus.,The primary outcome of the study was virus generation rate in tidal breathing of participants infected by different respiratory viruses and the efficacy of face masks in preventing virus dissemination in exhaled breath, separately considering the respiratory droplets and aerosols. The secondary outcomes were correlation between viral shedding in nose swabs, throat swabs, respiratory droplets and aerosols and factors affecting viral shedding in respiratory droplets and aerosols.,We identified three groups of respiratory viruses with the highest frequency of infection as identified by RT\u2013PCR, namely coronavirus (including NL63, OC43, HKU1 and 229E), influenza virus and rhinovirus, for further statistical analyses. We defined viral shedding as log, virus copies per sample and plotted viral shedding in each sample (nasal swab, throat swab, respiratory droplets and aerosols); the latter two were stratified by mask intervention. As a proxy for the efficacy of face masks in preventing transmission of respiratory viruses via respiratory droplet and aerosol routes, we compared the respiratory virus viral shedding in respiratory droplet and aerosol samples between participants wearing face masks or not, by comparing the frequency of detection with a two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test and by comparing viral load (defined as log, virus copies per sample) by an unadjusted univariate Tobit regression model, which allowed for censoring at the lower limit of detection of the RT\u2013PCR assay. We also used the unadjusted univariate Tobit regression to investigate factors affecting viral shedding in respiratory droplets and aerosols without mask use, for example age, days since symptom onset, previous influenza vaccination, current medication and number of coughs during exhaled breath collection. We investigated correlations between viral shedding in nasal swab, throat swab, respiratory droplets and aerosols with scatter-plots and calculated the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient between any two types of samples. We imputed 0.3 log, virus copies ml, for undetectable values before transformation to log, virus copies per sample. All analyses were conducted with R v.3.6.0 (ref. ,) and the VGAM package v.1.1.1 (ref. ,).,Further information on research design is available in the , linked to this article.", "5": "The Covid-19 pandemic led to threatening shortages in healthcare of medical products such as face masks. Due to this major impact on our healthcare society an initiative was conducted between March and July 2020 for reprocessing of face masks from 19 different hospitals. This exceptional opportunity was used to study the costs impact and the carbon footprint of reprocessed face masks relative to new disposable face masks. The aim of this study is to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to assess and compare the climate change impact\u00a0of disposed versus reprocessed face masks. In total 18.166 high quality medical FFP2 face masks were reprocessed through steam sterilization between March and July 2020. Greenhouse gas emissions during production, transport, sterilization and end-of-life processes were assessed. The background life cycle inventory data were retrieved from the ecoinvent database. The life cycle impact assessment method ReCiPe was used to translate emissions into climate change impact. The cost analysis is based on actual sterilization as well as associated costs compared to the prices of new disposable face masks. A Monte Carlo sampling was used to propagate the uncertainty of different inputs to the LCA results. The carbon footprint appears to be 58% lower for face masks which were reused for five times compared to new face masks which were used for one time only. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the loading capacity of the autoclave and rejection rate of face masks has a large influence on the carbon footprint. The estimated cost price of a reprocessed mask was \u20ac1.40 against \u20ac1.55. The Life Cycle Assessment demonstrates that reprocessed FFP2 face masks from a circular economy perspective have a lower climate change impact\u00a0on the carbon footprint than new face masks. For policymakers it is important to realize that the carbon footprint of medical products such as face masks may be reduced by means of circular economy strategies. This study demonstrated a lower climate change impact\u00a0and lower costs when reprocessing and reusing disposable face masks for five times. Therefore, this study may serve as an inspiration for investigating reprocessing of other medical products that may become scarce. Finally, this study advocates that circular design engineering principles should be taken into account when designing medical devices. This will lead to more sustainable products that have a lower carbon footprint and may be manufactured at lower costs. We compared disposable face masks that were used once with face masks that were sterilized and used five more times (six times in total). Sterilisation and PFE test data of the Aura 1862+ (3M, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA) face mask indicate that this type of face mask shows good performance after multiple sterilisation cycles,. In a previous pilot study, the company CSA Services (Utrecht, the Netherlands), a sterilization facility for cleaning, disinfection and sterilization of medical instruments, was rebuild to process FFP2 face masks. In total, 18,166 single use FFP2 masks were sterilised after use in a medical autoclave. As the majority (n\u2009=\u20097993) were Aura 1862+ (3M, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA), this particular type of face mask was chosen for the LCA.,The total weight of the face masks and packaging together during end-of-life consists of incineration for the face masks (97%) and landfill for the carton box packaging of new face masks (3%). There is no recycling potential used in our model since the materials coming from the operating room and its packaging is commonly disposed as medical waste. In the Netherlands, no energy recovery takes place at the incineration of regulated medical waste. Therefore, no co-function was applicable for the end-of-life scenario.,Recycling is often a multi-functional process that produces two or more goods. To deal with the multi-functionality in the background processes, the cut-off approach was applied to exclude the allocation of the greenhouse gas emissions to additional goods. This means that potential rest materials such as energy gained during incineration are cut-off and that the greenhouse gas emissions are fully allocated to the waste treatment processes itself.,In the LCA, the \u2018functional unit\u2019 defines the primary function that is fulfilled by the investigational products and indicates how much of this function is considered,. In this study, we pragmatically chose as a definition for the protection of 100 health care workers against airborne viruses, using one FFP2 certified face mask, each during one working shift of an average of 2\u00a0h in a hospital in the Netherlands.,Table , shows the differences between the two scenarios:,100 masks including packaging, transported from production to the hospital, used and disposed.,100 times use of reprocessed masks. We calculated that 27.1 masks are being produced and transported from production to the hospital. The 27.1 are being reprocessed five times, taking into account that 20% of the batch cannot be reprocessed. Therefore 80% of the batch could be used for reprocessing after each step resulting in: 27.1 (new)\u2009+\u200921.7 (repro 1)\u2009+\u200917.3 (repro 2)\u2009+\u200913.9 (repro 3)\u2009+\u200911.1 (repro 4)\u2009+\u20098.9 (repro 5)\u2009=\u2009100 times of use. For each time of reprocessing the batch is transported from the hospital to the (hospital) Central Sterilization Services Department (CSSD) and disposed after five times of reprocessing.,Combining the functional unit with the two alternative scenarios results in the reference flows for the protection of 100 health care workers against airborne viruses, either using a face mask one single time (100 virgin masks produced for the 1st scenario), or reusing a face mask for five additional times (27.1 virgin masks produced for the 2nd scenario). For both reference flows, only FFP2 certified face masks are considered. For the calculations each mask is used for a single two hours working shift in an average hospital in the Netherlands.,The inventory data includes all phases from production (including material production and part production), transport, sterilisation to end-of-life of the life cycle of the single use and reprocessed face masks. We disassembled one face mask to obtain the weight of each individual component on a precision scale (Fit Evolve, Bangosa Digital, Groningen, the Netherlands) with a calibrated inaccuracy of 1.5%. Component information and materials were obtained from the data fact sheet provided by the manufacturer. We conducted a separate validation experiment to establish the material composition in the filtering fabric (Supplement file).,This LCA with the Aura 3M masks was based on steam sterilization by means of a hospital autoclave and therefore part of this study. Therefore, face masks were placed in a sterilization bag that contained up to five masks. A total of 1000 masks were placed into an autoclave (Getinge, GSS6713H-E, Sweden) per cycle. After sterilization, the masks were transported to the hospital. Masks were reprocessed for a maximum of five times before final disposal,.,The assessment of climate change impact\u00a0is done following as closely as possible the internationally accepted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method following the ISO 14040 and 14044 standards,. The LCA examines all the phases of the product''s life cycle from raw material extraction to production, packaging, transport, use and reprocessing until final disposal,. The LCA was modelled using SimaPro 9.1.0.7 (PR\u00e9 Sustainability, Amersfoort, The Netherlands). The background life cycle inventory data were retrieved from the ecoinvent database (Ecoinvent version 3.6, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland),.,To make a valid comparison between the disposable and reprocessing face masks, the system boundaries should be equal in both scenarios. The system boundaries in this study consisted of the production, the use and the disposal and waste treatment of the masks. For the reprocessed face masks, the lifecycle is extended due to the sterilisation process (Fig.\u00a0,). Therefore, the additional PPE\u2019s and materials needed to safely process the masks (e.q. masks, gloves and protective sheets) are included in the production phase. The production of machinery for the manufacturing of the face masks and the autoclave were not included in this study.,System boundary overview of new and reprocessed face masks including waste treatment by incineration.,The production facility for the face masks is located in Shanghai, China,. Further distribution took place from Bracknell, UK to Neuss, Germany and the final destination was set in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.,The packaging materials were disposed in the hospital where the face masks are used primarily. After first use, face masks were transported to the sterilisation department. All masks were manually checked before reprocessing by personnel wearing PPE. Of all used Aura 1862+ facemasks that entered the CSA, approximately 10% was discarded. To remain conservative, the LCA was conducted based on a 20% rejection rate as a result of face masks which could not be reused anymore due to deformities, lipstick, and broken elastic bands.,A full overview of the life cycle inventory table for the two scenarios and details on model assumptions are added in the Supplemental file (Supplemental file, Part B),The carbon footprint (kg CO, eq) was chosen as the primary unit in the impact category. ReCiPe was applied at midpoint level and used to translate greenhouse gas emissions into climate change\u00a0impact,.,The final LCA model contains several uncertainties based on assumptions and measurement inaccuracies,. The included uncertainties were based on weighted components of the masks as well as the packaging which were measured with 1.5% inaccuracy of the precision scale apparatus. A Monte Carlo sampling, was conducted for both alternatives (disposable and reprocessing) where input parameters for the LCA were sampled randomly from their respective statistical distributions in for 10,000 \u2018runs\u2019. Because input parameters between scenarios were partly overlapping, we compared these two scenarios directly using a discernibility analysis. This technique, establishes which scenario is beneficial for each of 10,000 Monte Carlo runs. We report the percentage of instances where the reprocessing scenario has a lower carbon footprint than the disposable scenario.,A sensitivity analysis was conducted to check the sensitivity of the outcome measures to variation in the input parameters. To determine which parameters are interesting to investigate, three aspects were considered: the variations in number of face masks per sterilization cycle (autoclave capacity), rejection rate (number of losses per cycle) and transport distance to the CSSD. Finally, we included the relative contribution of these variations. The following three parameter variations were chosen for the sensitivity analysis:,Rejection percentage. The rejection rate was defined based on experiences from the participating sterilisation department and studies that show that sterilisation of the face masks up to 5 times is possible. Masks were re-used for 5 times, approximately 10% was discarded during the total life cycle. Out of this experience and to remain conservative, the total rejection rate was set on 20%. Therefore it is interesting to investigate whether variation in PFE testing outcomes or differences in user protocols influence the outcomes. This should indicate if masks from higher or lower quality can also be suitable candidates for reprocessing.,Autoclave capacity, which largely depends on the loading of the autoclave. To mimic different loads of the autoclave, it is interesting to know the influence of sterilizing fewer masks per run on the model.,Transport. As it is likely that many hospitals have a Central Sterilisation Services Department (CSSD) it is interesting to know the effect of having zero transportation. Moreover, in case hospitals are not willing to change the routing in their CSSD it is interesting to observe how outcomes are influenced if transportation is set on the maximal realistic value of 200\u00a0km.,The parameters have been varied with 250 and 500 face masks per sterilisation batch. A rate varying with 10% and 30% of the face masks being rejected due to quality reasons and variation in transport kilometres of 0\u2013200\u00a0km.,There is a small difference between the baselines of the sensitivity, LCIA and contribution analyses because all these are performed using separate Monte-Carlo simulations. The output of the different simulations may show minor differences due to statistical distribution.,A cost analysis was made to give insight in costing from a procurement perspective. The cost analysis is conducted with five face masks that were steam sterilized per batch in a permeable laminate bag, Halyard type CLFP150X300WI-S20 and includes the expenses of energy, depreciation, water consumption, cost of personnel, overhead and compared to the prices for a new disposable 3M Aura face mask during the first and second Corona waves. Five pieces per bag were chosen in order to have enough space between the masks to sterilise each mask properly. The cost analysis is based on actual sterilization as well as associated costs compared to the prices of new disposable face masks. The costs were then related to the functional unit of protecting 100 health care workers by calculating the difference in the amount of Euros per 100 face masks. The impact category outcomes of new versus reprocessed face masks over a functional unit of 100 times use with Standard Deviation (SD) for carbon footprint are:,6.55E+00 (SD 3.11E\u221201) kg CO, eq for new face masks.,2.77E+00 (SD 1.21E\u221201) kg CO, eq for reprocessed face masks.,The carbon footprint is approximately 3\u00a0kg CO, eq for 100 times of protection with a face mask which is (re)sterilized and reused for an additional five times.,The relative difference on carbon footprint is 58% lower for (re)sterilised face masks compared to face masks that are disposed after one time of use.,Figure\u00a0, shows the normalized contribution expressed in percentages of the total carbon footprint of a disposable mask.,Sources of impact relative to the impact category carbon footprint.,Compared to disposal, reprocessing of face masks showed a lower climate change\u00a0impact.,The contribution analysis shows that the highest reduction in climate change is caused by the production phase of the face masks. The production phase is reduced from 4.55\u00a0kg CO, eq to 1.24\u00a0kg CO, eq. Moreover, the impact caused by transport reduces from 0.65 to 0.24\u00a0kg CO, eq and the end-of-life impact decreases from 0.93 to 0.35\u00a0kg CO, eq.,Sterilization however, has a significant impact on the total results of reprocessed face masks. This phase contributes with 0.83\u00a0kg CO, eq. When comparing to disposable masks, reprocessed face masks even when including sterilization, remains the alternative with a lower impact on climate change.,The discernibility analysis indicated that the reprocessing scenario had a lower climate change\u00a0impact.,Figure\u00a0, shows the sensitivity analysis outcomes, including the baseline results and results using different autoclave loading capacity, rejection rate after inspection and transport differences.,Sensitivity analysis. Left of dotted line, baseline disposable (masks used only one time) versus reprocessed face masks with benchmark autoclave loading capacity of 1000 masks, rejection rate of 20% and transport distance of 46.1\u00a0km. Right of dotted line, effect on carbon footprint of different autoclave loading capacity, different rejection rates and different transport distances from hospital to sterilisation site.,The baseline characteristics for the autoclave capacity was determined for 1000 face masks per cycle and a transport distance from the hospital to the CSSD of 46.1\u00a0km. We assumed that 80% of the masks were reused each time the mask came back into the CSSD for reprocessing. When the autoclave capacity drops to 250 or 500, the CO, emissions increases by 57% and 17% respectively. If 70% of the face masks are reused, the CO, emissions increase with 8%. If 90% of the face masks are reused, the emissions decrease with 14%. If the travel distance changes to 200\u00a0km as a max feasible distance, the CO, emissions increases with 2%. Reducing the distance to 0 when the CSSD is inside the hospital decreases the emissions with 7%.,The results of the sensitivity analysis show that even with relatively large variations in changing parameters, the reprocessed face masks continue to have a lower impact in all categories when compared to using new disposable masks (Supplemental file, Part C). The uncertainty and discernibility analysis were performed (solely) over the weight of the mask. The results demonstrate that the inaccuracy of the scale does not affect the fact that reprocessed mask has a lower score in terms of climate change as compared to disposable masks.,The cost price of a reprocessed mask by means of steam sterilization in a permeable laminate bag is \u20ac1.40. The purchase price of a new, disposable face mask was \u20ac7 during the peak time of shortages in the hospital Haaglanden MC. The prices after the first Corona wave dropped to \u20ac186.06 per 120, having an average price of \u20ac1.55 per Aura 1862 face mask. Saving 560 Euro per 100 protected healthcare workers in the first wave and 15 Euro in the second Corona wave when using reprocessed masks."}
